# Demo of RGSE

This project is about the demonstration of symbolic regular verification (SRV).

SRV is a dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) based technique for verifying regular properties.

The file [manuel.pdf](https://github.com/srv4j/artifact/blob/master/manuel.pdf) introduces how to run the test scripts.

The docker image of SRV can be downloaded from [this link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Amd07GCbYt_zbxJyuQMi46pJqfo).
